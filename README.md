# CS160 Data Structures in GO | Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
### <i>Written by Vincent Buchner and Soren Basnet</i>
Welcome to our collection of basic data structures implemented in the GO programming language. This repository provides clear and concise implementations of essential data structures, including stacks, queues, deques, linked lists, doubly linked lists, trees, recursions, and graphs. Each data structure is designed to be easily accessible and understandable for developers looking to utilize fundamental data structures in their Go applications.

## Stacks
Our stack implementation follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, allowing for efficient operations such as push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing the top element).

## Queues
The queue implementation adheres to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, supporting operations such as enqueue (adding an element to the rear) and dequeue (removing an element from the front).

## Deques
Our deque (double-ended queue) implementation allows for efficient insertion and deletion at both the front and rear ends, providing flexibility for various use cases.

## Linked Lists
The linked list implementation offers a flexible data structure where each element (node) points to the next, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.

## Doubly Linked Lists
Similar to linked lists, our doubly linked list implementation also includes a reference to the previous node, enabling bidirectional traversal and efficient backward insertion and deletion operations.

## Trees
Our tree implementation encompasses various types such as binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees, offering hierarchical data organization and efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Recursions
We provide examples of recursive algorithms that showcase the power of recursion for solving complex problems through repeated function calls.

## Graphs
Our graph implementation covers fundamental graph structures and algorithms, including representations such as adjacency lists or matrices, and operations for traversal, connectivity, and pathfinding.

We hope that you find these implementations valuable for your Go projects. Feel free to explore, contribute, and utilize these basic data structures to enhance your applications.

Happy coding!
